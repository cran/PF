\value{
  A \code{\link{rrsi}} object with the following elements.
  \item{estimate}{vector with point and interval estimate}
  \item{estimator}{either \emph{PF} or \emph{IDR}}
  \item{y}{data vector} \item{k}{Likelihood ratio
  criterion} \item{rnd}{how many digits to round the
  display} \item{alpha}{complement of confidence level}
}
\description{
  Estimates likelihood support interval for the incidence
  density ratio or prevented fraction based on it.
}
\details{
  Estimates likelihood support interval for the incidence
  density ratio based on orthogonal factoring of
  reparameterized likelihood. The incidence density is the
  number of cases per subject-time; its distribution is
  assumed Poisson. \cr \cr Likelihood support intervals are
  usually formed based on the desired likelihood ratio,
  often 1/8 or 1/32. Under some conditions the log
  likelihood ratio may follow the chi square distribution.
  If so, then \eqn{\alpha=1-F(2log(k),1)}, where \eqn{F} is
  a chi-square CDF. \code{RRsc()} will make the conversion
  from \eqn{\alpha} to \emph{k} if \code{use.alpha = TRUE}.
  \cr \cr The data may also be a matrix. In that case
  \code{y} would be entered as \code{matrix(c(y1, n1 - y1,
  y2, n2 - y2), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE)}.
