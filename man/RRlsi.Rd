\value{

  interval estimates - see details} \item{estimator}{either
  \code{"PF"} or \code{"RR"}} \item{y}{data vector}

\description{
  likelihood support interval for the risk ratio or
  prevented fraction by the likelihood profile.
}
\details{
  Estimates a likelihood support interval for \emph{RR} or
  \emph{PF} by the profile likelihood method using the DUD
  algorithm. \cr \cr Likelihood support intervals are
  usually formed based on the desired likelihood ratio,
  often 1/8 or 1/32. Under some conditions the log
  likelihood ratio may follow the chi square distribution.
  If so, then \eqn{\alpha=1-F(2log(k),1)}, where \eqn{F} is
  a chi-square CDF. \code{RRlsi()} will make the conversion
  from \eqn{\alpha} to \emph{k} if \code{use.alpha = TRUE}.
  \cr \cr The data may also be a matrix. In that case
  \code{y} would be entered as \code{matrix(c(y1, n1-y1,
  y2, n2-y2), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE)}.
